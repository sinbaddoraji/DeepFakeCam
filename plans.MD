# DeepFake Webcam Application Development Plan

## Overview
A desktop application that captures webcam input, applies deepfake transformations using a target face image, and outputs to a virtual webcam. The application will have a graphical user interface for controlling the webcam, selecting target faces, and adjusting transformation settings.

## Core Features
- Select input webcam device from available devices
- Start/stop webcam capture
- Upload and select target face images for deepfake transformation
- Preview both original and transformed video streams
- Output to virtual webcam for use in video conferencing applications
- Save and load face presets

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend (GUI)
- Use Qt framework for cross-platform desktop GUI
- Main window with:
  - Video preview area (split view for original/transformed)
  - Webcam device selection dropdown
  - Start/Stop capture buttons
  - Target face selection panel with thumbnails
  - Transformation settings controls

### Backend
- Reuse the existing DeepFakeModel C++ class
- Extend to support multiple deepfake models:
  - Face swap (SimSwap approach)
  - Face animation (First Order Motion Model)
  - Face attributes modification

### Development Phases

#### Phase 1: Basic GUI and Integration
1. Create Qt-based GUI application shell
2. Integrate existing webcam capture and v4l2loopback functionality
3. Add webcam selection dropdown
4. Implement basic start/stop functionality
5. Create simple preview window

#### Phase 2: Target Face Management
1. Add file browser for selecting target face images
2. Implement target face storage and management
3. Create thumbnail view of available target faces
4. Add face preset save/load functionality

#### Phase 3: Enhanced Deepfake Features
1. Integrate ONNX Runtime for model execution
2. Add support for multiple deepfake model types
3. Implement transformation settings controls
4. Add real-time adjustment of transformation parameters

#### Phase 4: Polish and Optimization
1. Improve UI design and usability
2. Optimize performance for real-time processing
3. Add keyboard shortcuts
4. Create installer/package for easy distribution

## Implementation Details

### Qt UI Components
- QMainWindow as the application container
- QComboBox for webcam device selection
- QPushButton for start/stop and other actions
- QLabel and custom QWidget for video previews
- QFileDialog for image selection
- QSlider for adjustment controls

### Backend Integration
- Connect Qt signals/slots to the existing DeepFakeModel class
- Create worker threads for video processing to keep UI responsive
- Use OpenCV for image processing and face detection
